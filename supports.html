            <h2>Why Partnerships Matter</h2>
            <p>
                Children do best when the adults in their lives work together. Families, educators and community services each bring their own strengths,
                and when these are combined, children receive stronger and more consistent support. Our centre values honest communication, trust and shared decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Partnerships also help families feel connected, especially during times of stress or change. You never have to manage things alone. We are here to walk alongside you.

            <h2>Working With Professionals to Support Your Child</h2>
            <p>
                Some children may benefit from extra help from professionals outside the centre. We collaborate with a wide range of services, including:

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Child and family health nurses.</li>

                <li>Psychologists and counsellors.</li>
                <li>NDIS early childhood and disability providers.</li>
                <li>Mental health services.</li>
                <li>Child protection and family support agencies.</li>
                <li>Medical and hospital teams.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When we work together, children experience consistent guidance across home, healthcare and the early learning environment.
